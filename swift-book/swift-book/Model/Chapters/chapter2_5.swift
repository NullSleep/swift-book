        // Swift's 'switch' statement is considerably more powerful than its counterpart in many C-like languages. Cases
        // can match many different patterns, including interval matches, tuples, and casts to a specific type. Matched
        // values in a 'switch' case can be bound to temporary constant or variables for use within the cas's body, and
        // complex matching conditions can be expressed with a 'where' clause for each case.

        // A while loop performs a set of statements until a condition becomes false. These kinds of loops are best
        // used when the number of iterations is not know before the first iteration begins. Swift provides two kinds
        // of while loops:
        // - while evaluates its condition at the start of each pass through.
        // - repeat-while evaluates its condition at the end of each pass through the loop.
        
        // MARK: While - Creating a simple game of Snakes and Ladders
        // The rules of the game:
        // - The boards has 25 squares, and the aim is to land on or beyond square 25.
        // - The player staring squere is "square zero", which is just off the bottom-left corner of the board.
        // - Each turn, you roll a six-sided dice and move by that number of squares, following the horizonal path
        //   indicated by the dotted arrow in the assets file.
        // - If your turn ends at the bottom of a ladder, you move up that ladder.
        // - If your turn ends at the head of a snake, you move down that snake.
        
        // The game board is represneted by an array of Int values. Its size is based on a constant called 'finalsquare',
        // which is used to intialize the array and also to check for a win condition later in the example. Because the
        // players start off the board, on "square zero", the board is intialized with 26 zero Int values, not 25.

        // to +08, which is equivalent to an integer of value 8 (the difference beterrn 3 and 11). To align the values and
        // statements, the unary plus operatior (+i) is expecitly used with the unary minus operator (-i) and numbers
        // lower rhan 10 are padded with zeros. (Neither stylistic technique is strcitly necessary, but they lead to
        // neater code.)

        // The example above use a very simple approach to dice rolling. Instead of generating a random number, it starts
        // with a diceRoll value of 0. Each time through the while loop, diceRoll is incremented by one and is then
        // checked to see wheter it has become too large. Whenever this return value equal 7, the dice roll has become
        // too large and is reset to a value of 1. The result is a sequence fo diceRoll values that is always 1, 2, 3, 4,
        // 5, 6, 1, 2 and so on.
        
        // A while loop is appropiate in this case, because the lenght of the game is not clear at the start og the
        // while loop. Instead, the loop is executed until a particular condition is satisfied.
