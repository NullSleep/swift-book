        // Swift provides a variety of control flow statemnets: while, if, guard, break, continue, for-in
        
        // Swift's 'switch' statement is considerably more powerful than its counterpart in many C-like languages. Cases
        // can match many different patterns, including interval matches, tuples, and casts to a specific type. Matched
        // values in a 'switch' case can be bound to temporary constant or variables for use within the cas's body, and
        // complex matching conditions can be expressed with a 'where' clause for each case.
        
        // MARK: - FOR-IN LOOP
        // You use the for-in loop to iterate over a sequence, such as items in a array, ranges of numbers, or characters
        // in a string.
        let names = ["Anna", "Alex", "Brian", "Jack"]
        for name in names {
            print("Hello \(name)!")

        // Iterating over a dictionary to access its key-value pairs.
        let numberOfLegs = ["spider": 8, "ant": 6, "cat": 4]
        for (animalName, legCount) in numberOfLegs {
            print("\(animalName)s have \(legCount) legs")
        }
        
        // The contents of a Dicationary are inherently unordered, and iterating over them does not guarantee the order
        // in which they will be retrieved. In particular, the order you insert items into a Dictionary doesn't define
        // the oreder thye are iterated.
        
        // For-in loop with numeric ranges
        // The sequence being iterated over is a range of numbers from 1 to 5, inclusive, as indicated by the user of the
        // closed range operator (...)
        // 'index' is a constant whose value is automarically set a the start of each interation loop. As such, 'index'
        // does not have to be declared before it is used. It is implicitly declared simply by its inclusion in the loop
        // declaration, without the need for a let declaration keyword.
        for index in 1...5 {
            print("\(index) times 5 is \(index * 5)")
        }

        // variable name.

        let power = 10
        var answer = 1
        for _ in 1...power {

        // MARK: - WHILE LOOPS
        // A while loop performs a set of statements until a condition becomes false. These kinds of loops are best
        // used when the number of iterations is not know before the first iteration begins. Swift provides two kinds
        // of while loops:
        // - while evaluates its condition at the start of each pass through.
        // - repeat-while evaluates its condition at the end of each pass through the loop.
        
        // MARK: While - Creating a simple game of Snakes and Ladders
        // The rules of the game:
        // - The boards has 25 squares, and the aim is to land on or beyond square 25.
        // - The player staring squere is "square zero", which is just off the bottom-left corner of the board.
        // - Each turn, you roll a six-sided dice and move by that number of squares, following the horizonal path
        //   indicated by the dotted arrow in the assets file.
        // - If your turn ends at the bottom of a ladder, you move up that ladder.
        // - If your turn ends at the head of a snake, you move down that snake.
        
        // The game board is represneted by an array of Int values. Its size is based on a constant called 'finalsquare',
        // which is used to intialize the array and also to check for a win condition later in the example. Because the
        // players start off the board, on "square zero", the board is intialized with 26 zero Int values, not 25.
        let finalSquare = 25
        var board = [Int](repeating: 0, count: finalSquare + 1)
    }
