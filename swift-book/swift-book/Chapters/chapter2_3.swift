        // Swift String type is a value type. When creating a new String value, that String value is copied when it is
        // passed to a function or methods, or when it is assigned to a constant or variable. In each case, a new copy
        // of the exisiting String value is created, and the new copy is passed or assigned, no the original version.
        
        // Swift's copy by default String behaviour ensure that when a function or method passes you a String value,
        // it is clear that you own that exact String value, regardless of where it came from. You can be confident
        // that the string you passed will not be modified unless you modify it yourself.
        
        // * Working with Characters *
        // Individual Characters values for a String can be accessed by iterating over the string with a for-in loop:
        for character in "To do two things at once is to do neither ~ Publilius Syrus üò¨" {
            print(character)

        // single character.
        
        // * String Interpolation *
        // String interpolation is a way to construct a new String value from a mix of constants, variables, literals
        // and expressions by including their values inside a string literal. String interpolation can be used in both
        // single line and multiline string literals. Each item that you insert into the string literal is wrapped
        // in a pair of parentheses, prefixed by a backlash (\)

        // Unicode: International standard for enconding, representing, and processing text in different wirtting systems.
        // It enables to represent almost any character for any language in a standarized form, and to read and write
        // those chracters to and from an external soruce such as a text file or web page.
        // Swift native String type is built from Unicode Scalar values. A Unicode scalar is a unique 21-bit number
        // for a character or modifier. No all 21-bit Unicode scalars are assigned to a character, some schalar
        // are reserved for future assigment.
        
        // String literals cna include the following special characterts:
        // \0 null character
        // \\ backslash
        // \t horizontal tab
        // \n line feed
        // \r carriage return
        // \" double quote
        // \' double quote

        // Every instance of Swift's Character type represents a single extended grapheme cluster. An extended
        // grapheme cluster is a sequence of one or more Unicode scalars that (when combined) produce a single human-
        // readable character.
        
        // The letter √© can be represented as the single Unicode scalar √© (LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE, or U+00E9)
        // However, the same letter can also be represented as a pair of scalars, a standard letter e (LATIN SMALL
        // LETTER E, or U+0065), followed by the COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT scalar (U+0301)
        let eAcute: Character = "\u{E9}"

        print(combinedEAcute)
        
        // Extended grapheme clusters are a flexible way to represent many complex script characters as a single value.
        // For example Hangul syllables from the Korean alpahbet can be repsented as either a precomposed or decompsed
        // sequence.
        let precomposed: Character = "\u{D55C}"
        print(precomposed)
        let decomposed: Character = "\u{1112}\u{1161}\u{11AB}"
        print(decomposed)
        
        // Extended grapheme clusters enable scalars for enclosing marks (such as COMBINING ENCLOSING CIRCLE, or U+20DD)
        // to enclosed other Unicode scalars as part of a single Character value:
        let enclosedEAcute: Character = "\u{E9}\u{20DD}"
        print(enclosedEAcute)
        
        // Unicode scalars for regional indicator symbols can be combined in pairs to make a single Character value, such
        // as this combination of REGIONAL INDICATION SYMBOL LETTER U (U+1F1FA) and REGIONAL INDICATOR SYBOL LETTER S
        // (U+1F1F8)
        let regionalIndicatorForUS: Character = "\u{1F1FA}\u{1F1F8}"
        print(regionalIndicatorForUS)
        
        // * Counting Characeters *
        let unusualMenagerie = "Carpe Diem Baby üò¨üî•üíµ"
        print("unusualMenagerie has \(unusualMenagerie.count) chracters")
        
        // Note that Swift's use of extended grapheme culsters for Character values means that string concatenation and
        // modification may not always affect a string's character count.

        print("The number of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")

        print("The number of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")
        
        // Extended grapheme clusters can be composed of multiple Unicode scalars. This means that different characters,
        // and different representations of the same chracter, can require different amounts of memory to store. Because
        // of this, characters in Swift do not each take up the same amount of memory within a string's representation.
        // As a result, the number of characters in a string cannot be calculated without iterating through the string to
        // deteremine its extended grapheme cluster boundaries. If you are working with particularly long string values,
        // be aware that the count property muest iterate over the Unicode scalars in the entiner string in order to
        // determine the characters for that string.
        //
        // The count of the characters returned by the count porperty is not always the same as the lenght property
        // of an NSString that contains the same characters. The lenght of an NSString is based on the number of
        // 16-bit code units withing the string's UTF-16 representation and no the number of Unicode extended grapheme
        // clusters within the string.
        print("\n---\n")
        
        // ** Accessing and Modifying a String **
        
        // * String Indices *
        // Each String value has an associated index type, String.Index, which corresponds to the position of each
        // Character in the string.
        // Since different characters can require different amounts of memory to store, so in order to determine which
        // Character is at a particular position, you must iterate over each Unicode scalar from the start or end of
        // that String. For this reason, Swift string cannot be indexed by integer values.
        
        // Use the startIndex property to access the position of the first Character of a String. The endIndex property
        // is the position after the last character in a String. The endIndex property is the position after the last
        // character in a String. As a result, the endIndex property isn't a valid argument to a string's subscript. If
        // a String is empty, startIndex and endIndex are equal.
        
        // You access the indices before and after a five index using the index(before:) and index(after:) methods for
        // String. To access an index farther away from the given index, you can use the index(_:offsetBy:) method
        // instead of calling one of these methods multiple times.
        let greeting = "Our greatest fears lie in anticipation. Patience is the greatest of all virtues."
        print(greeting.startIndex)
        print(greeting[greeting.index(before: greeting.endIndex)])
        print(greeting[greeting.index(after: greeting.startIndex)])
        let index = greeting.index(greeting.startIndex, offsetBy: 13)
        print(greeting[index])
        
        // Attempting to access and index outisde of a string's range or a Character at an index outside of a string's
        // range will trigger a runtime error
        //        print(greeting[greeting.endIndex]) // Error
        //        print(greeting.index(after: greeting.endIndex)) // Error
        
        // Using the indices property to access all of the indices of individual characters in a string
        for index in greeting.indices {
            print("\(greeting[index]) ", terminator: "")
        }
        print("\n")
        
        // The startIndex and endIndex properties and the index(before:), index(after:) and index(_:offsetBy) mehtods can
        // be used on any type that conforms to the Collection protocol. String and collection types such as Array,
        // Dictionary and Set all conform to the Collection protocol.
        
        // * Inserting and Removing *
        var welcome = "The key to happiness and confidence is progress."

        welcome.remove(at: welcome.index(before: welcome.endIndex))
        print(welcome)

        // that confroms to the RageReplaceableCollection protocol. This includes String, as well as collection types
        // such as Array, Dictionary and set.
        
        // * Substrings *
        // Substrings in Swift have most of the same methods as string, which means uou can work with substrings like
        // strings. Unlike string, substrings are used only for a short amount of time.
        let greetings = "Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character"
        let indexg = greetings.index(of: "b") ?? greetings.endIndex
        let begining = greetings[..<indexg]
        print(begining)
        // Convert the result to a String for long-term storage
        let newString = String(begining)
        print(newString)
        
        // Like strings, each substring has a region of memmory where the chracters that make up the substring are stored.
        // The difference between strings and substrings is that, as a performance optimization, a substring can re-use
        // part of the memory that's used to store the original string, or part of the memory that's used to store another
        // substring. This performance optimization means you don't have to pay the performance cost of copying memory
        // until you modify either the string or substring. Substrings aren't suitable for long-term storage--because they
        // re-use the storage of the original string, the entire original string must be kept in memory as long as any
        // of its substrings are being used.
        
        // In the example above, greeting is a string, which means it has a region of memory where the charcaters that
        // make up the string are stored. Because beginning is a substring of greetings, it re-uses the memory thtat
        // greeting uses. In contrats, newString is a string--when it's created from the substring, it has its own storage.
