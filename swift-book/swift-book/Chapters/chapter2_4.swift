        // Swift provide three primary collection types, known as arrays, sets, and dictionaries, for sorting colelctions
        // of values. Array are ordered collections of values. Sets are unordered collections of unique values.
        // Dictionaries are unordered collections og key-value associations.
        
        // Arrays, sets, and dictionaries in Swift are always clear about the types of values and keys that they can store.
        // This means that you cannot insert a value of the worng type into a collection by mistake. It also means you
        // can be condifent about the type of values you will retrieve from a colleciton.
        
        // Swift's array, set and dictionary type are implemented as generic collectionns.
        
        // ** Mutability of Collections **
        // If you create an array, set, or a dictionary, and assign it to a variable, the collection that is created will
        // be mutalbe. This means that you can change (or mutate) the collection after it is created by adding, removing,
        // or changing iterms in the collection.
